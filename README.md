### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Machine Learning and Data Science enthusiast.  <br />
I've done projects regarding machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, deep learning & neural networks.  <br />


You can check my end-to-end projects :
* [Flight Fare Prediction ML flask web-app](https://github.com/Prajwal10031999/Flight-Fare-Prediction-ML-Web-App-With-Deployment)


In my repositories you will also find projects done by using transfer learning techniques viz :<br />

* [VGG](https://github.com/Prajwal10031999/Cataract-Detection-using-VGG-19)
* [RESNET](https://github.com/Prajwal10031999/Cats-or-Dogs-Classification-using-CNN-with-RESNET-50)
* [INCEPTION](https://github.com/Prajwal10031999/Dog-Breed-Classification-Using-InceptionV3)
* [ALEXNET](https://github.com/Prajwal10031999/Scene-Prediction-using-CNN-with-AlexNet)
