### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Machine Learning and Data Science enthusiast.  <br />
I've done projects regarding machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, deep learning & neural networks.  <br />

In my repositories you will also find projects done by using transfer learning <br />
techniques like VGG-16, VGG-19, INCETION-V3,XCEPTION, MOBILE-NET, DENSE-NET, RESNET, ALEXNET etc. <br />


Also you can find some projects on Artificial Intelliegence in Medical Science
